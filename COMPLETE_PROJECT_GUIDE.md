   - Monitor election progress and results

### Election Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Admin creates election with title, description, start/end times
2. **Registration**: Voters and candidates register
3. **Approval**: Admin approves eligible participants
4. **Voting**: Active voting period
5. **Results**: Transparent, tamper-proof results

- `POST /voting/approve/candidate` - Approve/reject candidate

## Security Features

### Cryptographic Security
- **ECDSA P-256**: Digital signatures for transaction authentication
- **Public/Private Key Pairs**: Secure identity management
- **Transaction Signing**: All transactions must be signed
- **Hash Verification**: Transaction integrity verification

### Voting Security
- **Double Voting Prevention**: Blockchain state tracks votes

- **Identity Verification**: IPFS document storage for verification

### Network Security
- **P2P Communication**: Secure node-to-node communication
- **Transaction Validation**: All nodes validate transactions
- **Block Validation**: Consensus ensures block integrity

2. Frontend signs transaction with private key
3. API server receives transaction
4. Transaction added to mempool
5. Validator includes in new block
6. Block propagated to network
7. State updated across all nodes

### Voting Flow
